Graceful degradation refers to designing an application to provide core functionality even under less-than-ideal conditions, such as slow or absent network connections. Service workers are a key technology in supporting graceful degradation by enabling caching and offline access. They allow apps to load previously accessed content even when the network is unavailable, ensuring the application remains usable and performant regardless of connection quality.
